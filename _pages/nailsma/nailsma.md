CyberTracker is the mobile data collector technology used by [NAILSMA](https://nailsma.org.au/). This is distributed under the [I-Tracker](https://nailsma.org.au/projects/i-tracker/) name.

## Training portal
NAILSMA has developed an online easy to follow [CyberTracker Training and Technical Support Portal](https://cybertrackertraining.com/get-started).

## What is NAILSMA?
NAILSMA has been developing and delivering training on digital data management systems to Indigenous Ranger Groups, Government Agencies and Non-Government Organisations for the last 10 years. As a result we have learnt alot about the need for ongoing support, developing skills and the building capability and confidence amongst staff and practitioners.
