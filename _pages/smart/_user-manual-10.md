{: .note }
SMART Mobile can accommodate multiple configurable models for example for different patrol mandates or objectives. In the example below the device can be used either for recording law enforcement or wildlife patrols, each with its own unique configuration.

If you need to exit from SMART Mobile after you have selected the configurable model enter the default exit pin code **"1234**" and press the green button, or have your SMART data manager enter the correct pin code. See [SMART Technical Training
Manual](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SMART%206%20Technical%20Training%20Manual_2019_07_sm.pdf): Module 9: CyberTracker Plug-In and Smart Mobile* for more details on pin codes and 'Kiosk mode'.

After selecting the configurable model, you are ready to begin recording the Patrol Configuration

1. Select **Start Patrol** then you will see a screen to enter the patrol configuration
2. The GPS automatically starts to look for satellites and will return the location after achieving a 3D fix
- SMART Mobile will not allow a patrol to start until it has gotten a location (i.e., you will see coordinate in the "Location" box). This may take a few minutes if the device is new and getting a GPS location for the first time or hasn't been used recently.
