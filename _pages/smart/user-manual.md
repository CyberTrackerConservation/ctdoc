Purpose
-------
{: .no_toc }
The purpose of this training resource is to provide a guide on how to collect field data using automated processes (SMART Mobile and CyberTracker). The intended target groups for training are field rangers, other frontline staff and ecological monitoring staff who work on site in terrestrial and marine protected areas, community conservancies, private reserves and other conservation areas.

Acknowledgements
----------------
{: .no_toc }
The training handbook was prepared by the SMART Training Taskforce, a group of dedicated SMART users who work broadly across geographic regions, sites and situations where SMART is being implemented, in terrestrial and marine environments. The Training Taskforce is one working group under the SMART Partnership which currently comprises the following organizations: Frankfurt Zoological, Global Wildlife Conservation, North Carolina Zoo, Panthera, Peace Parks, Wildlife Protection Solutions, WCS, WWF, and ZSL.

Overview
--------
{: .no_toc }
This training resource covers the practical aspects of field data collection using patrol forms, navigation using GPS, data recording on handheld devices using SMART Mobile in conjunction with configured data models, and data upload to SMART. The first section of the handbook introduces the rationale for law enforcement monitoring and the use of field patrol data for decision-making and adaptive management. The second section covers methods of data collection using logbooks, patrol forms, GPS, smartphones and SMART Mobile, and special applications (ecological monitoring and profiles data collection). Examples from some of the >1000 SMART implementation sites are used to provide context. In the final section, core tasks of the data collector for ensuring SMART data can be useful for adaptive management are presented.
