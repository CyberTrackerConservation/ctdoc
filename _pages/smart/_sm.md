## 4.4 Recording observations using SMART Mobile

From the patrol screen you may end, pause or change your patrol, simply
select "Patrol" to enter the menu at the bottom of your screen.

You should select **Pause patrol** when the team is not actively engaged
in search activity for example when taking a meal break, when waiting
for radio orders from a patrol supervisor, or if a vehicle is broken
down. You can only pause a patrol if you checked the pause patrol box in
the Cybertracker settings. Hit **Pause patrol** again to restart the
patrol after it was paused.

Note: The 'Pause Patrol' function must be enabled in the CyberTracker
properties for it to be visible on patrol (See Section 4.2.5 -- above).

You may want to change the transport type, mandate, employees or leader
during the patrol as the situation requires. A significant enhancement
in SMART Mobile is the ability to change patrol metadata during the
patrol. For example, if your patrol began as a foot patrol and later
continued by vehicle, you would use this function to change your patrol
transport type from "foot" to "vehicle" with the ease of a few taps,
rather than having to end and restart your patrol with different data.
The device will make a note of when and where this occurred for more
accurate information on your patrols. Once you download the data to
SMART, the different sections of the patrol will automatically display
as different patrol legs.

You would select **End patrol** after you have completed your patrol
route, have returned to your station or have stopped recording
observations and do not plan to resume again for the rest of the day or
evening.

During a patrol you can also access the following functions: 

a.  **Map**: Check your GPS location while on patrol and view
    > observation locations and the tracklog

b.  **History**: Check the observations that were recorded during the
    > patrol

c.  See individual observations, times & dates

## 4.5 Detailed Steps for Recording Observations using SMART Mobile

Select 'Make observation' at the top of the screen to record patrol
observations (below a) relating to SMART data model categories
(wildlife, human activities, features and patrol movements etc). In the
example below an observation of human activity is recorded b) then
details of people encountered is recorded c) along with a photo d).
To finish entering data for an observation select the tick box at the
top right of the screen (see red box in top-right of d below). Once the
observation has been recorded, save the incident selecting the green
button at the bottom right of the screen (below e).

**SMART Mobile: Additional Data Collection Features **

**Independent Incidents: **

SMART Mobile now allows you to collect data not associated with a
patrol, on a handheld device. To use this feature, you will need to
install the 'Independent Incident' plugin to your SMART database via the
'**File \> Install New Plugins**' menu. Once you have done this, you can
re-export your patrol package and select a configurable model to be used
for independent incidents which can differ from your chosen patrol
model. For more information on independent incidents see: *[[SMART 6

## 4.6 Importing SMART mobile patrols into SMART 

It is not necessary to use SMART mobile in a connected environment.
SMART mobile data collection can be done outside of telephone 3G or 4G
networks. However, if you are using SMART Connect with the data queue
wifi settings enabled (see the Advanced Administration with SMART
connect training handbook) simply ending your patrol will send data to
the data queue which can be downloaded directly into SMART desktop.

For offline use, to import the data collected in SMART Mobile directly
to SMART Desktop:

A.  Connect your mobile device to your computer using the cable

B.  Make sure device is connected for 'file transfer'

C.  Open SMART Desktop and go to **Field Data\>SMART Mobile\>Import...**

## 4.9 Field exercise: Data collection using SMART Mobile equipped devices

-   Divide into teams to conduct a practice patrol around the training
    > site

-   Collect data on the handheld devices; record the patrol
    > configuration, then start taking observations at simulated crime
    > scenes

-   Try to be vigilant and observant, especially for signs of human
    > activity, wildlife, and features. Also record the start and end of
    > a patrol, and any changes in movements of the patrol teams such as
    > rest stops or change of transportation (foot to vehicle, vehicle
    > to foot etc.)

-   When the patrol is finished, import your data to SMART via the SMART
    > Mobile or CyberTracker field data interface. Compare patrol
    > results between teams. 

# 7. Using SMART for adaptive management; tasks for the data collector

As mentioned in [[Section 1]](#smart-mobile-setup), SMART is
designed to help improve the protection of conservation areas through
streamlining the conversion of field data collected by rangers into
information on human activities and threats to wildlife that can be used
for strategic planning. For this process to work, a SMART database
should receive regular updates and be managed effectively. The data
manager plays an important role in making sure that data and information
flows happen. The key tasks are described below:

1.  **Ensure data are collected -** Patrols should be conducted on a
    > regular basis to ensure protection and monitoring activities and
    > associated data flows. Patrols can be scheduled for each team,
    > station or planned by using the Planning Module in SMART (see:
    > *[[SMART Technical Training
    > Manual]](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SMART%206%20Technical%20Training%20Manual_2019_07_sm.pdf):
    > Module 6: Planning and Intelligence*).

2.  **Ensure data come in on time -** There should be a directive for
    > what happens to the data once patrol teams have brought in their
    > devices from the field. A responsible person should be assigned to
    > upload data to the SMART database. Patrol data should be entered
    > as soon as possible after patrols are completed so as to ensure
    > that events requiring action such as poaching, encroachment,
    > harvest of wildlife or other resources or other illegal activities
    > are quickly brought to the attention of the manager. This should
    > be done as a part of the routine debrief process for patrols, so
    > data can be reviewed, corrected and input together with the team
    > who collected the data.

> If data are being transferred manually or where SMART Connect is
> deployed but connectivity is limited or absent, a system should be set
> in place to ensure regular transfer of data from the field to the data
> manager. For example, waypoints, tracklogs and field forms may be
> submitted to the data manager within a set timeframe.

3.  **Ensure data a correct -** Data needs to be checked for quality and
    > accuracy by the data manager before it gets incorporated in basic
    > analysis (queries and summaries) and appears in reports. At the
    > end of each patrol a debrief should be done with the team
    > collecting data. The debrief should involve the following steps;

    1.  Verbal report from the patrol leader to his/her supervisor on
        > the patrol including patrol objectives, patrol mandate, team
        > composition, route of travel, major results (wildlife, threats
        > encountered, actions taken)

    2.  Upload the data to SMART and run the quality assurance tool on
        > the data. Further information on how and what to check for, as
        > well as how to use the SMART Quality Assurance tool, can be
        > found in the *[[SMART Quality Assurance Module
        > Handbook]](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/SMART%20QA%20Module%20Manual.pdf).*

4.  **Ensure feedback from the manager is followed up on -** Further
    > considerations for adaptive management under the SMART approach
    > are discussed in the [[*SMART Adaptive Management Training
    > Handbook*.]](https://smartconservationtools.org/release/623/)
