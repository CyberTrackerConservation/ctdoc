# SMART Mobile
CyberTracker is the mobile data collector technology used by [SMART](https://smartconservationtools.org).

## What is SMART?

Protected areas are the cornerstone of nature conservation. Despite their vital role in the prevention of species extinctions, protected areas continue to be poorly resourced and managed, with less than a quarter providing effective protection.
<br/><br/>
In an effort to make protected areas more successful at preventing the loss of nature, in 2011 nine leading conservation organizations joined forces to create the [SMART](https://smartconservationtools.org/About/About-us) partnership. Our response to the unprecedented loss of wildlife, in alignment with global policies and scientific priorities, is to support the management of conservation areas providing refuge and a safe haven to threatened fauna and flora.
