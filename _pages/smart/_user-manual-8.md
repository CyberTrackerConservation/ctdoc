## Creating a Package

Now that you have created your configurable model that can be used to efficiently collect your data, you can export your Data Collection Package from your SMART desktop to your mobile device as follows:

[There are two options, manual export via a USB connection, or download
direct from SMART connect]

### Manual export via USB connection
1. Open your SMART database.
2. Connect your mobile device to your computer USB port using the device's download cable
3. Make sure the device is connected for 'file transfer'
4. Export the configurable model you will be using by clicking, "Field Data-\>SMART Mobile-\>Packages"... and then on the SMART Mobile Packages dialog that allows you to export either Local or Connect packages click on +Add and select Patrol Package as your SMART Mobile Package Type.

5. Set "Export Location" as "Device".

7. Select your preferred basemap (Leave min/max at the defaults, and lower the "Max" to number (e.g., to 1 or 2) to speed up the export).
8. Check Collect Independent Incidents and select your Configurable Model an Independent Incident Model if you wish to enable this option.

{: .note }
When updating a configurable model (for example to add new employees added to list) and needing to update the devices, if it is the same patrol package name, SMART Mobile will overwrite it. Just go through the same workflow as before to export the configurable model to the device.
