## 1. Introduction
This manual describes the functions and usage of the SMART Mobile software application.

The intended audience is users of the SMART Desktop application who are configuring field data collection. Field users or rangers may also use this manual to understand the various configurations and how they function.

The manual does not describe the SMART Desktop application, although it may make reference to various desktop configuration options. Readers are encouraged to learn the desktop application before reading this manual.

### 1.1. What is SMART Mobile?
SMART Mobile is a mobile phone application that is used by rangers to capture data from the field.

The SMART Desktop application defines the data model and SMART Mobile uses this definition to prompt the rangers to collect data. 

Rangers capture data and then download it into SMART Desktop for reporting and analysis.
