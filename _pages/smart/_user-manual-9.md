## SMART Mobile Desktop Simulator InstructionsÂ for Windows (64 Bit)

The SMART Mobile simulator runs on Windows desktop and is intended to help with training and testing. To get started, follow the following steps:

1. Download the zipped SMART Mobile simulator program files
2. The SMART Mobile desktop simulator is available at [www.smartconservationtools.org](http://www.smartconservationtools.org)
3. Extract the files to a local folder on your computer.
4. Open SMART desktop and export a Patrol Package to file:
- When exporting to a file, set the file location to \"C:\\users\\\<YourName\>\\Downloads\" or \"C:\\users\\\<YourName\>\\Desktop\", being sure to replace <YourName\> with whatever your local user name on the machine is.
- The file name is not important, as long as it ends in .zip. When the desktop simulator processes the file, it will remove it from the directory.
- The exported file MUST have a ZIP extension
