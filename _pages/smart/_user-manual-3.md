Limitations:

### 3.4. Android APK
SMART Mobile can be installed directly onto an Android using an APK. An APK is a single file that holds an Android application.

The APK file for SMART Mobile is available for download from the Download option on the SMART Conservation Tools website: [https://smartconservationtools.org/](https://smartconservationtools.org/Download/SMART-7-Release). 

Limitations:
* Updates will not be automatic. 
* Updates will require repeating the installation process with a new APK.

To start, select **Install SMART Mobile on Device…** from the **Field Data** menu and **SMART Mobile** submenu:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image82.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

Use the ‘**…**’ button and select the APK file from the file system and click **Next**:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image102.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

Then select **Copy SMART Mobile to device** and click **Next**:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image31.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

Select the device to copy SMART Mobile to and then click **Copy application to selected devices**. Devices will have more than one entry if they have an additional SD card. There is no harm in selecting all of them.
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image37.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

If the device does not show up in the list, make sure the USB cable is connected to your PC and that the USB mode on the device is set to **File Transfer**:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image173.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

Clicking **Refresh** will retry the connection.

Note that this can be used to copy to several devices, just plug in a new device and repeat the process (**Refresh** then **Copy**).

Next open the Files viewer application on the device and navigate to the Internal Storage folder and find the APK. Then tap on it to install it.

A prompt may appear to allow installation of apps from unknown sources. If so, choose **Settings** and then enable **Allow from this source**:
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image204.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image78.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image186.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

When running SMART Mobile for the first time, a prompt will appear to switch your Android home launcher app to SMART Mobile. Do not switch the launcher to SMART Mobile.

### 3.5. Windows desktop
