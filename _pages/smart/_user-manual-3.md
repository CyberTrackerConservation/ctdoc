## How are field data collected for use with SMART?

There are two broad categories of data collection: manual data
collection, involving filling in of paper forms together with a GPS
device, and automated data collection, involving use of handheld
electronic devices such as PDAs, tablets and smartphones (Fig. 3). Both
are designed to help rangers collect information in a standardised way.
This allows information collected over time, or by different observers,
to be comparable, which is a critical factor in studies employing many
field rangers or field staff. Each approach has its advantages and
disadvantages that need to be evaluated when considering which
particular method to employ in a conservation area. For the purposes of
this handbook, we will focus instruction on automated data collection
using SMART Mobile. (For further information about manual data collection using SMART please see: [SMART Technical
Training
Manual](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SMART%206%20Technical%20Training%20Manual_2019_07_sm.pdf): Module 3: Patrols).

### Automated data collection using handheld devices

Handheld devices such as PDAs, tablets and smartphones may further
simplify and speed up the process of data collection and transfer when
used in conjunction with SMART Mobile or CyberTracker Classic, an
application for the collection and visualization of field data. SMART
Mobile and CyberTracker currently run off of the Android Operating
System (OS), with plans for an Apple iOS version in the near future.
CyberTracker Classic remains available on Windows Mobile.

Important: The desktop application of CyberTracker is only available for
the Windows OS, meaning that the import or export of Patrol/Survey
Configurable Models or data collected from the field cannot be currently
done on a Mac OS or Apple computer not running Windows.

SMART Mobile/CyberTracker are used to record observations based on a
configured version of your SMART data model (see: [SMART Technical
Training
Manual](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SMART%206%20Technical%20Training%20Manual_2019_07_sm.pdf):
Module 9: CyberTracker Plug-In and Smart Mobile). GPS waypoint and
tracklog and observation data are collected simultaneously and uploaded
to SMART in a semi-automated process (see details in section 3.3.4
below).

### SMART Mobile and CyberTracker Classic - what is the difference?

SMART Mobile is powered by CyberTracker (CT), offering functionality and
user experience enhancements specifically requested by the SMART user
community, as well as much tighter integration with the SMART desktop
software and SMART Connect. SMART Mobile uses a GPS-enabled mobile
device to collect both observations (text and/or icon-based data entry
and digital images) and GPS data in a single unit. Patrols and
observations can then be transferred directly into SMART desktop by
connecting the device, or remotely through SMART Connect (see: [SMART
Technical Training
Manual](https://smartconservationtools.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SMART%206%20Technical%20Training%20Manual_2019_07_sm.pdf):
Module 13: Connect Plug-in) in semi-automated processes.

### Features of SMART Mobile 

#### Modern easy to use user interface
SMART Mobile has a modern easy to use user interface:

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image184.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image180.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image194.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">Fig. 4a. The user interface includes smooth scrolling, easy to use lists and high-resolution icons.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Support for more environments

<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image191.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image191.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">Fig. 4b. Dark mode, multi-language support and large fonts.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Modern state of the art mapping
The state-of-the-art mapping in SMART Mobile, includes the ability to complement online base maps with offline maps generated directly from SMART desktop:

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image197.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image192.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image190.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">Fig. 5. Pinch-zoom, map rotation and navigation.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Navigation to previous observations
Includes detailed sighting history views. This feature turns SMART mobile into a functional navigation device:

<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image198.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image196.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image195.png" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">Fig. 6. View your sighting history in the field, individual sightings can be edited without disrupting patrols/surveys & supports users to navigate to previously visited locations.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Other mapping features
- Sightings, Incidents, Tracks are visible
- Offline maps overlaid on base map
- 10 online base maps: OpenStreetMap, National Geographic, Satellite, Oceans, etc.
- Offline mode where no basemap is required
- Layers can be turned on and off
- Inspect
- Navigation with realtime pointer
- Compass
- Detailed data
- Satellite view
- Smooth panning, pinch-zoom and rotation
- Rotate to north at top button
- Zoom in, zoom out buttons
- Follow modes: user, follow, navigation
- Co-ordinates in decimal degrees, degrees minutes seconds, degrees decimal minutes and UTM

#### Multi-leg patrols
Patrol type can now be changed while the patrol is in progress. Also, patrols can now be easily paused and resumed. When paused the track timer is disconnected, ensuring that SMART delivers an even more accurate measure of effort:

</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="3">Fig. 7. New functionality for multi-leg patrols allows changes to patrol metadata on the fly.</td>
</tr>
</table>

#### Desktop demo version for training
SMART Mobile also has a desktop demo version for Windows which works exactly the same as the mobile version that can be used for training. The GPS simulation can be customized for your location as part of the training.

#### Robust kiosk mode
SMART Mobile supports a robust kiosk mode that locks the device for use only by SMART Mobile. Kiosk mode can be exited with a preconfigured pin.

#### Simple, Customizable, Themes
Ability to customize the look and appearance of SMART Mobile from within SMART selecting theme colors and your own project icon.

#### Independent incidents during patrols/surveys
During or outside of a patrol or survey, observations can be recorded independently from a patrol or survey. These observations are recorded as independent incidents in SMART:

<table>
<tr>
<td align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image193.png"/></td>
<td align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/smart/image184.png"/></td>
</tr>
<tr>
