## What is KoBoToolbox?

[KoBoToolbox](https://kobotoolbox.org) is a suite of tools for field data collection, primarily used in challenging environments. Developed by the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, KoBoToolbox allows users to collect, manage, analyze, and visualize data in real-time.

It offers a range of functionalities useful for researchers and organizations operating in remote locations or disaster-stricken areas. These include the ability to create and deploy mobile surveys, collect data offline, geolocate survey responses, and design custom reports.

The toolbox is particularly favored by humanitarian and international development organizations because it is free and open-source, allowing for a high degree of customization while also ensuring data security.

## CyberTracker Connector
CyberTracker supports data collection for KoBoToolbox. This includes downloading forms, data collection and submission. CyberTracker extensions are not visible in the KoBoToolbox form editor. To use them, you must maintain the XlsForm separately and redeploy it when changes are made.

Custom CyberTracker functions are activated using the [XlsForm extensions]({{ site.baseurl }}/xlsform/reference-manual).
