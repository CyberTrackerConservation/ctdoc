# Privacy Policy
We take your privacy seriously and want you to feel confident when using the app. This privacy policy outlines the information we collect and how we use it.

## Definitions
For the purposes of this Privacy Policy:
**You** means the individual using the App.

**Provider** means the server technology on behalf of whom data is being collected, e.g. CyberTracker Online, SMART, EarthRanger, KoBoToolbox, etc.

## Information we collect
The app collects usage statistics such as the number of times it is opened and which features are used. Usage data never contains personally identifiable information. However, collected data (on behalf of a Provider) may contain personally identifiable information. If your Provider uses location services, your device's location information may be captured. However, this data is only sent to the Provider and not separately collected or used by the app.

The app contains a feature whereby you can manually share a bug report. This report may contain personally identifiable information, so it should be shared cautiously. However, this will never happen automatically.
