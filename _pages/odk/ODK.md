[ODK](https://getodk.org/) is an open-source mobile data collection platform. It enables users to fill out forms offline and send form data to a server when a connection is found. Once on the server, the data can be viewed, downloaded, and acted upon.

ODK is primarily used by organizations working in humanitarian aid and global development. Notable users include World Health Organization, International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and Carter Center. ODK has been recognized by the Digital Public Goods Alliance as a digital public good.
