## Do I need to uninstall previous versions?

No, CyberTracker automatically upgrades previous versions.

All settings and data are preserved.

## Why are there two versions?

Windows applications can be installed in two different ways: for a
single user or for all users.

A single-user install means that CyberTracker will only be available for
the user who installed it. This is the recommended install type.

An all-user/admin install means that all users on the machine use a
single installed version. In order to use this version, you must have
administrator rights on your system.
