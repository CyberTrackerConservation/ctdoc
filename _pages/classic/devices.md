## Field Testing of Mobile Devices for Use with SMART/Cybertracker

Richard A. Bergl, North Carolina Zoo

### Testing Conditions

We conducted field testing of seven different mobile devices to assess
their suitability for use in wildlife and conservation monitoring in a
tropical forest environment.

Field Testing was conducted at the Mbe Mountains Community Reserve, in
Cross River State, Nigeria. Mbe is an area of high topographic relief,
characterized by steep slopes and deep valleys. The entire testing area
consisted of dense tropical rain forest, though vegetation on steep
slopes was occasionally lower and more herbaceous in nature. Humidity at
the site is high and annual rainfall is over 3,500mm. Testing was
conducted by Wildlife Conservation Society staff and Mbe Mountains
community ecoguards, all of whom were already familiar with data
collection using mobile devices.

Testing was carried out over four days, towards the end of the rainy
season. Devices were loaded with Cybertracker software running an
application currently in use at Mbe for wildlife and law enforcement
monitoring. Each day the testing team traversed a different area using a
combination of forest trails and off-trail navigation. At the beginning
of each day a start point was recorded at the basecamp area before field
work began. Subsequently, a position was recorded approximately every 20
minutes over the course of the day. Devices were activated
simultaneously and held within approximately 3m of each other. Time to
first fix, number of satellites at 2 minutes post activation, and
dilution of precision at 2 minutes were recorded. Each device was also
set to record an automated “track log” point every 5 minutes. Percentage
of battery power remaining was recorded at the beginning and end of each
day.

### General Notes

It was noted that the “kiosk mode” of Cybertracker does not work with
Android devices, apparently due to active blocking of this and similar
features by Google. Users desiring to lock devices to only run
Cybertracker/SMART should use Windows-based devices or employ 3rd party
Android apps to prevent devices running other programs. Additionally,
some Android devices report error to Cybertracker/SMART in a
non-standard fashion. While Cybertracker has since been modified to
accommodate the type of error calculated, some of the long times to
position acquisition for some Android devices may be related to this.

### Summary

#### CAT B15

![Device\_CAT\_B15.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_CAT_B15.png "Device_CAT_B15.png")

  - GPS position acquisition generally good
  - Less expensive
  - Best Android smartphone tested

**Disadvantages**  
\* Battery life poor compared to other devices

  - Some question as to waterproofness of battery cover
  - Poor track log performance, especially when battery was low

-----

#### Runbo X5

![Device\_Runbo\_X5.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_Runbo_X5.png "Device_Runbo_X5.png")  
**Advantages**  
\* Less expensive

  - External battery pack available, potentially doubling operating time
  - Wide array of accessories available

**Disadvantages**  
\* Track log performance only average

  - Battery life on T41C less than T41CG-may be related to firmware
    update on T41CG
  - Relatively expensive compared to non-Trimble devices
  - Device as tested does not include GSM capability (available as an
    optional extra)

-----

#### Trimble Juno T41CG

![Device\_Trimble\_Juno\_T41CG.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_Trimble_Juno_T41CG.png "Device")  
**Advantages**  
\* Large touchscreen easy to use

  - Large virtual keyboard easy to use
  - Excellent battery life
  - Excellent GP position acquisition
  - Battery non-removable: may be an advantage for waterproofness
  - External battery pack available, potentially doubling operating time
  - Wide array of accessories available

**Disadvantages**  
\* Most expensive device

  - Device as tested does not include GSM capability (available as an
    optional extra)

-----

#### RugGear RG960/Land Rover Experience

![Device\_RugGear\_RG960.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_RugGear_RG960.png "Device")  
**Disadvantages**

  - Poor GPS reception
  - Poor battery life
  - Not recommended

-----

#### Pharos 585

![Device\_Pharos\_585.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_Pharos_585.png "Device")  
**Advantages**  
\* Excellent GPS acquisition (best of tested devices)

  - Excellent battery life
  - Small form factor
  - Less expensive
  - Best non-Trimble device tested

**Disadvantages**  
\* Lower ruggedness rating than other devices

  - Small amount of built in memory
  - Small resistive touchscreen harder to use (especially with virtual
    keyboard) and prone to damage over time
  - No storage location for stylus

-----

#### Nomad 900L

![Device\_Nomad\_900L.png]({{ page.img_source }}/Device_Nomad_900L.png "Device")  
**Advantages**  
\* Excellent GPS Acquisition

  - Excellent battery life
  - Wide array of accessories available

**Disadvantages**  
\* Small resistive touchscreen harder to use (especially with virtual
keyboard) and prone to damage over time

  - Relatively expensive compared to non-Trimble devices
  - Device as tested does not include GSM capability (available as an
    optional extra)

-----

### Recommendations

  - Overall best choice, based on all factors: Trimble T41C, due to a
    combination of ruggedness, screen type, GPS performance, price. Note
    that tracklog performance was lower than some other devices however.
  - When higher GPS accuracy in a rugged device is preferred, and where
    cost is less of an issue: Trimble Juno T41CG
  - When a less expensive device is preferred and where
    ruggedness/waterproofness is less important: Pharos 585
  - When and Android-based smartphone is preferred: CAT B15 or Runbo X5.
    Note that CAT B15 track log performance was poor and Runbo X5 had
    long times to position acquisition.
