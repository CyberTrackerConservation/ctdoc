# Getting started
CyberTracker is a tool to collect field data. In order to do this, it needs to know what data to collect and where to send it. This information comes from a Project which needs to be added.

## Adding a Project
There are several ways to add a Project to CyberTracker:
1. Scan a **QR Code** using your phones QR code scanner
<br/>This is the simplest way to get a project. The QR code contains everything that CyberTracker needs to find and add the project.

1. Open an **Link** from an email or text message
<br/>If you have received a link to a project, then clicking on it and opening it with CyberTracker will add the project.

1. Select a **Login** and choose a Project
<br/>Several providers require a user to login with their username and password. This will add a project.

1. Scan projects installed from a **Desktop**
<br/>CyberTracker Classic and SMART can install a project on a device via cable. This is a useful option when the device is not online.
