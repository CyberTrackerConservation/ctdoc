## [What is EarthRanger?](https://earthranger.com/Faqs.aspx)
EarthRanger is an easy-to-use online software solution developed by Vulcan Inc. to meet the unique needs of protected area managers, ecologists, and wildlife biologists. Our solution collects, integrates and displays all historical and real-time remote sensing data available and combines it with reports from the field to provide one unified view of collared wildlife, field observations, rangers, enforcement assets, and infrastructure within a protected area. The visualized data are analyzed by operational teams and scientists to track and study animal movements, identify and respond to potential threats, and understand ecological changes.
