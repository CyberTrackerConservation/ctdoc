## Goal
This tutorial shows how to start working with CyberTracker XlsForm extensions. By the end, you will be able to quickly make and test form changes within a desktop environment. This is generally much quicker and easier than deploying to a mobile device.

## Requirements
- Windows (64-bit) or Mac
- Excel or other XlsForm editor

## Steps
### 1. Download, install and launch CyberTracker
Visit the [Download page]({{ site.baseurl }}/xlsform/download) and follow the instructions to install and launch CyberTracker. 

### 2. Download the project package 
Download the [package]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xlsform/tutorial-getting-started.zip).

### 3. Install the package in CyberTracker
Use the `File->Install package` menu option and navigate to the file that was downloaded.

<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xlsform/tutorial-x2.png" /></td>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xlsform/tutorial-x3.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

### 4. Open the `CTProjects` folder on the desktop
CyberTracker creates a folder on the desktop called `CTProjects`. Open this folder and navigate to the `Projects` sub-folder inside it. You will then see a folder for the Project you have just created. Open it and notice that it contains a file called `form.xlsx`.
<table>
<tr>
<td><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/xlsform/tutorial-x4.png" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

### 5. Open the form, make a change and save it
- Open `form.xlsx` and make a change. For example, add a new animal in the `choices` sheet, or a new question in the `survey` sheet. 
- Save the form
